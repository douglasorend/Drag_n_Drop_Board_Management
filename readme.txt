[color=blue][b][size=12pt][u]Introduction[/u][/size][/b][/color]
This mod adds the ability to drag and drop individual boards to new positions either within the category it resides, or within a new category.  

This mod is based on the Manage Boards UI of the [url=http://www.elkarte.net]ElkArte[/url] fork of SMF (which is licensed under a [url=http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause]3-clause BSD License[/url]), which has this functionality built in.
